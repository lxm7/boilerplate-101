### Part of this repo was for a tech test. I've since decided to give it some bells and whistles and make it my own boilerplate for starting new projects.

Bare-bones template in `master`.
3 previous tech tests included in `with-test-examples`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development build

### yarn
### yarn start
### yarn test


## Production build

### yarn build
### yarn global add serve
### serve -s build
