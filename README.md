### My own boilerplate for starting new projects / demos, etc. Includes Typescript, Jest, pre-hooks.

## Aerian Demo

Please run:

`yarn`

`yarn start`

Click the SunriseSunset in the left side Nav to view test (other links are from older tests i keep together in one place)

For the sunrise sunset demo I used the [Suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) library to get sunrise/set times.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development build

### yarn

### yarn start
