### My own boilerplate for starting new projects / demos, etc. Includes Typescript, Jest, pre-hooks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

TODO: Look to tag this version and then a later one with replaced / aligned React Hooks with Redux Hooks (7.1).
